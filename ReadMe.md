# TFS Rest Service

Simple service that abstracts calls to the TFS REST API and provides back data objects to be used in TypeScript/JavaScript.

Used as part of the Build Tasks for Triggering another build in TFS (see https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=benjhuser.tfs-extensions-build-tasks).
